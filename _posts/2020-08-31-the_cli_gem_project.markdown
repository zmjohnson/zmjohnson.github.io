OK. I wish I could say this was a piece of cake. A lot of other people thought it was. I think. For me, though, it was pretty challenging. I ran into a lot of brickwalls with this project. Lets start with the positives though:

1. It's over
2. I actually learned a lot. Or rather, I refreshed a lot of stuff I didn't realize I had forgotten. 

The labs throughout the module were pretty straight forward. If I just caught the gist of the lessons, I can get through the labs with relatively low trouble. Surprise! This was a dumb move! I had trouble in the early stages of this project with the basics. Arrays, methods, variables THE BASICS. So I spent a good chunk of the project period just reteaching myself how to do stuff I should have mastered (or at least got the hang of) a month ago. The coding for the first week and a half was sloppy at best. Eventually though I caught up, which is where I encountered my second big issue: my code editor. I had downloaded Atom because that was the Github code editor. People everywhere love it! And I get why, it's pretty simple to use, just have to download a couple packages. What could go wrong? Well I guess Mac Catalina users don't have the lastest version of Ruby for one. And I didn't have permission to download gems. I don't know why, no one on the internet seems to be having this issue. I spent way too longer troubleshooting this. I never figured out these two issues. So I just used the not-always-reliable Learn.co Sandbox. It's fine. Except for the occasional freezing. When that happens, or you leave the Sandbox, or close you laptop, everything you have up on it vanishes. I ended up doing a lot of backtracking because of this. The icing on the headache cake was that now, for some reason, everyone's favorite gem, Pry, doesn't work on my Sandbox anymore. I don't know why, but that's an issue I'll deal with later. 

I know that was a lot of complaining, but I'm actually kind of proud of myself. I cruised through the first module way too quickly without actually retaining the information and suffered because of it during the final project. I was certain at several points that I'd have to retake the first module because I didn't have a project to turn in (hopefully I still won't). But I got through it. I learned a pretty harsh lesson, but I lived and I'm looking forward to the next module. 

What could go wrong?
