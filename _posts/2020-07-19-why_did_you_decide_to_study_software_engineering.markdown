When I was younger, I never knew what I wanted to do as a career for when I grew up. I knew what I wanted to be: happy. It didn't really matter what I did as long as I was happy. I got this mentality from a never-confirmed quote from John Lennon: "When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life." I knew that going to the beach made me happy, so I decided to study marine biology when I was in college. Fast-forward a decade later, and I haven't found much work in the biological field. I worked as a lab assistant for a bit, but it left my largely unsatisfied. I did a myraid of other jobs, but nothing really fit. I was always the "techy" guy in the office that people went to if they had issues with their computers, so maybe I figured maybe I should have majored in something more technlogical based. I figured I missed my chance to get a career that better fits me. 

Then I heard about The Flatiron School from a TikTok of all places. A 19-year-old found her career in software development after completing the completing the Software Engineering course. With only a limited amount of skills gathered from a decade of working, I figured why not. I signed up for the Bootcamp course and from there I haven't looked back. I didn't take to it like a fish takes to water, but that's okay as not many people do. *I am learning at least a couple new languages after all.* Now I am sitting on my porch finishing up The First Mile of my online course and am excited about the journey and the oppurtunities that this could lead to.
